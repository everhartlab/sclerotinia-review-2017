               world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily
               consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take
               it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging
               its ideas once were---and still are. The Structure of Scientific
               Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in
               1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of
               science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach.
               With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged
               long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing
               that transformative ideas don't arise from the day-to-day,
               gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but
               that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that
               disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur
               outside of ``normal science,'' as he called it. Though Kuhn was
               writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how
               scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass
               over time in research experiments are still instructive in our
               biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn's essential work in the
               history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian
               Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including
               paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn's ideas to the
               science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the
               book, Hacking's introduction provides important background
               information as well as a contemporary context. Newly designed,
               with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by
               the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history
               of our perspectives on science.",

              outcrossing of the pathogen would be helpful in developing
              disease management strategies. The population structure of S.
              sclerotiorum in the Columbia Basin from potato was examined using
              microsatellite markers and mycelial compatibility. Analysis of
              molecular variance revealed that 92\% of the variability among
              167 isolates was found within subpopulations, with limited, yet
              statistically significant impact of the collection date, but not
              the year or location of collection. Linkage disequilibrium and
              index of association analyses noted a potential for outcrossing
              in two locations, which was substantiated by the discovery of
              recombinant ascospores in three field-generated apothecia from
              the 12 apothecia examined. Microsatellite haplotypes were not
              correlated with mycelial compatibility groups. This high
              haplotypic diversity did not seem to impact pathologically
              important phenotypes. Greenhouse inoculations of potato plants
              exhibited no significant differences in aggressiveness on potato
              stems. Moreover, in vitro studies of response to fungicides and
              temperature stimuli yielded no significant differences among
              studied isolates. These findings illustrate the potential for
              outcrossing in warm temperate regions of North America, where a
              diversity of crops are planted simultaneously and in neighboring
              fields. This study also indicates that the unsatisfactory
              management of potato stem rot is likely not directly attributable

              formation represents a type of nonself recognition that has often
              been attributed to the heterokaryon incompatibility system, which
              limits the co-occurrence of genetically different nuclei in the
              same cytoplasm during the asexual phase of the life cycle. While
              the genetic basis of the heterokaryon incompatibility system is
              well characterized in Neurospora crassa, barrage formation has
              not been thoroughly investigated. In addition to the previously
              described Standard Mating Reaction barrage, we identified at
              least three types of barrage in N. crassa; dark line, clear zone,
              and raised aggregate of hyphae. Barrage formation in N. crassa
              was evident only when paired mycelia were genetically different
              and only when confrontations were carried out on low nutrient
              growth media. Barrages were observed to occur in some cases
              between strains that were identical at all major heterokaryon
              incompatibility (het) loci and the mating-type locus, mat, which
              acts as a heterokaryon incompatibility locus during the

              barrages did not form between strains that had genetic

              N. crassa can operate independently from that of heterokaryon
              incompatibility and mating type. Surprisingly, barrages were not
              observed to form when wild-collected strains of N. crassa were
              paired. However, an increase in the frequency of pairings that

              back-crossing wild strains to laboratory strains, or through
              successive rounds of inbreeding of wild-derived strains,
              suggesting the presence in wild strains of genes that suppress

              globe ~50,000 - 100,000 years ago. Movement into new

  abstract = "The number of fully sequenced fungal genomes is rapidly
              increasing. Since genetic tools are poorly developed for most
              filamentous fungi, it is currently difficult to employ genetic
              engineering for understanding the biology of these fungi and to
              fully exploit them industrially. For that reason there is a
              demand for developing versatile methods that can be used to
              genetically manipulate non-model filamentous fungi. To facilitate
              this, we have developed a CRISPR-Cas9 based system adapted for
              use in filamentous fungi. The system is simple and versatile, as
              RNA guided mutagenesis can be achieved by transforming a target
              fungus with a single plasmid. The system currently contains four
              CRISPR-Cas9 vectors, which are equipped with commonly used fungal
              markers allowing for selection in a broad range of fungi.
              Moreover, we have developed a script that allows identification
              of protospacers that target gene homologs in multiple species to
              facilitate introduction of common mutations in different
              filamentous fungi. With these tools we have performed RNA-guided
              mutagenesis in six species of which one has not previously been
              genetically engineered. Moreover, for a wild-type Aspergillus
              aculeatus strain, we have used our CRISPR Cas9 system to generate
              a strain that contains an AACU\_pyrG marker and demonstrated that
              the resulting strain can be used for iterative gene targeting.",

              unicellular organisms to plants and animals, ecological and
              particularly evolutionary studies on clonal species have been
              strongly limited by the difficulty in assessing the number, size
              and longevity of genetic individuals within a population. The
              development of molecular markers has allowed progress in this
              area, and although allozymes remain of limited use due to their
              typically low level of polymorphism, more polymorphic markers
              have been discovered during the last decades, supplying powerful
              tools to overcome the problem of clonality assessment. However,
              population genetics studies on clonal organisms lack a
              standardized framework to assess clonality, and to adapt
              conventional data analyses to account for the potential bias due
              to the possible replication of the same individuals in the
              sampling. Moreover, existing studies used a variety of indices to
              describe clonal diversity and structure such that comparison
              among studies is difficult at best. We emphasize the need for
              standardizing studies on clonal organisms, and particularly on
              clonal plants, in order to clarify the way clonality is taken
              into account in sampling designs and data analysis, and to allow
              further comparison of results reported in distinct studies. In
              order to provide a first step towards a standardized framework to
              address clonality in population studies, we review, on the basis
              of a thorough revision of the literature on population structure
              of clonal plants and of a complementary revision on other clonal
              organisms, the indices and statistics used so far to estimate
              genotypic or clonal diversity and to describe clonal structure in
              plants. We examine their advantages and weaknesses as well as
              various conceptual issues associated with statistical analyses of
              population genetics data on clonal organisms. We do so by testing
              them on results from simulations, as well as on two empirical
              data sets of microsatellites of the seagrasses Posidonia oceanica
              and Cymodocea nodosa. Finally, we also propose a selection of new
              indices and methods to estimate clonal diversity and describe

              parasite (or isolate) per host individual (or subpopulation),
              although each host (subpopulation) harbors a set of parasites

              crops in the North Central region of the United States. The
              objective of this study was to examine the genetic diversity of
              145 isolates of the pathogen from multiple hosts in the region.
              Mycelial compatibility groups (MCG) and microsatellite haplotypes
              were determined and analyzed for standard estimates of population
              genetic diversity and the importance of host and distance for
              genetic variation was examined. MCG tests indicated there were 49
              different MCGs in the population and 52 unique microsatellite
              haplotypes were identified. There was an association between MCG
              and haplotype such that isolates belonging to the same MCG either
              shared identical haplotypes or differed at no more than 2 of the
              12 polymorphic loci. For the majority of isolates, there was a
              one-to-one correspondence between MCG and haplotype. Eleven MCGs
              shared haplotypes. A single haplotype was found to be prevalent
              throughout the region. The majority of genetic variation in the
              isolate collection was found within rather than among host crops,
              suggesting little genetic divergence of S. sclerotiorum among
              hosts. There was only weak evidence of isolation by distance.
              Pairwise population comparisons among isolates from canola, dry
              bean, soybean and sunflower suggested that gene flow between
              host-populations is more common for some crops than others.
              Analysis of linkage disequilibrium in the isolates from the four
              major crops indicated primarily clonal reproduction, but also
              evidence of genetic recombination for isolates from canola and
              sunflower. Accordingly, genetic diversity was highest for
              populations from canola and sunflower. Distribution of
              microsatellite haplotypes across the study region strongly
              suggest that specific haplotypes of S. sclerotiorum are often
              found on multiple crops, movement of individual haplotypes among
              crops is common and host identity is not a barrier to gene flow

              subtle skills that are often not explicitly stated in book
              chapters or review articles on population genetics. What is a
              good sampling strategy? How many isolates should I sample? How do
              I include positive and negative controls in my molecular assays?
              What marker system should I use? This review will attempt to

              emerge from discussions with colleagues and from practical

              often leads to innate immunity to prevent the invasion of
              parasites and maintain the genetic polymorphism of organisms.
              Fungal vegetative incompatibility is a type of non-self
              recognition which often induces programmed cell death (PCD) and
              restricts the spread of molecular parasites. It is not clearly
              known whether virus infection could attenuate non-self
              recognition among host individuals to facilitate its spread.
              Here, we report that a hypovirulence-associated mycoreovirus,
              named {\textit{Sclerotinia sclerotiorum}} mycoreovirus 4 (SsMYRV4), could
              suppress host non-self recognition and facilitate horizontal
              transmission of heterologous viruses. We found that cell death in
              intermingled colony regions between SsMYRV4-infected Sclerotinia
              sclerotiorum strain and other tested vegetatively incompatible
              strains was markedly reduced and inhibition barrage lines were
              not clearly observed. Vegetative incompatibility, which involves
              Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins)
              signaling pathway, is controlled by specific loci termed het
              (heterokaryon incompatibility) loci. Reactive oxygen species
              (ROS) plays a key role in vegetative incompatibility-mediated
              PCD. The expression of G protein subunit genes, het genes, and
              ROS-related genes were significantly down-regulated, and cellular
              production of ROS was suppressed in the presence of SsMYRV4.
              Furthermore, SsMYRV4-infected strain could easily accept other
              viruses through hyphal contact and these viruses could be
              efficiently transmitted from SsMYRV4-infected strain to other
              vegetatively incompatible individuals. Thus, we concluded that
              SsMYRV4 is capable of suppressing host non-self recognition and
              facilitating heterologous viruses transmission among host
              individuals. These findings may enhance our understanding of
              virus ecology, and provide a potential strategy to utilize
              hypovirulence-associated mycoviruses to control fungal diseases.",

              genetic diversity of A. flavus can influence the effectiveness of
              atoxigenic isolates in mitigating aflatoxin contamination.
              However, such information has not been used to facilitate
              selection and deployment of atoxigenic isolates. A total of 35
              isolates of A. flavus isolated from maize samples collected from
              three agro-ecological zones of Nigeria were used in this study.
              Ecophysiological characteristics, distribution and genetic
              diversity of the isolates were determined to identify vegetative
              compatibility groups (VCGs). The generated data were used to
              inform selection and deployment of native atoxigenic isolates to
              mitigate aflatoxin contamination in maize. In co-inoculation with
              toxigenic isolates, atoxigenic isolates reduced aflatoxin
              contamination in grain by > 96\%. A total of 25 VCGs were
              inferred from the collected isolates based on complementation
              tests involving nitrate non-utilizing (nit(-)) mutants. To
              determine genetic diversity and distribution of VCGs across
              agro-ecological zones, 832 nit(-) mutants from 52 locations in 11
              administrative districts were paired with one self-complementary
              nitrate auxotroph tester-pair for each VCG. Atoxigenic VCGs
              accounted for 81.1\% of the 153 positive complementations
              recorded. Genetic diversity of VCGs was highest in the derived
              savannah agro-ecological zone (H = 2.61) compared with the
              southern Guinea savannah (H = 1.90) and northern Guinea savannah
              (H = 0.94) zones. Genetic richness (H = 2.60) and evenness (E5 =
              0.96) of VCGs were high across all agro-ecological zones. Ten
              VCGs (40\%) had members restricted to the original location of
              isolation, whereas 15 VCGs (60\%) had members located between the
              original source of isolation and a distance > 400 km away. The

              as AV0222, AV3279, AV3304 and AV16127, whose atoxigenic members

              (MCGs) is used routinely in many laboratories as a quick marker
              for genotyping {\textit{Sclerotinia sclerotiorum}} within populations.
              Scoring each new sample requires optimization of standardized
              conditions to support adequate growth of all paired isolates.
              Appropriate conditions for growth are especially important
              because diverse compatibility reactions are difficult to
              categorize and score (e.g., in samples from populations with high
              genetic diversity, such as those that receive immigration from
              genetically diverse sources or those that deviate from strict
              clonality). The current standard medium for MCG testing can be
              inhibitory to isolates from some samples, confounding scoring of
              compatibility. We identified two foci for optimization: (i)
              choice of medium, in this experiment, Patterson's medium amended
              with red food coloring (termed modified Patterson's medium, MPM,
              the current standard medium) versus potato dextrose agar (PDA)
              and (ii) amount of McCormick's red food coloring amended to the
              growth medium. The red food coloring often yields a red reaction
              line in incompatible interactions; alternative incompatible
              reactions are a line of thick or thin hyphae. Based on results to
              date, self-self pairings of S. sclerotiorum are compatible and
              are a reliable standard for scoring compatible self-nonself
              mycelial interactions. PDA amended with 75 microl/L of
              McCormick's red food coloring was identified as optimal for
              isolates inhibited by MPM from a highly diverse, recombining
              population sample. This precisely amended PDA was also suitable
              for isolates from highly clonal populations that were not
              inhibited by MPM or by higher concentrations of red food
              coloring. Under the optimized, standardized conditions all paired
              isolates grew together and produced interactions that could be
              scored in repeatedly identifiable categories, compatible or
              incompatible. Workers are advised to optimize conditions before

              species in nature is an unresolved question. Here we report

              Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. In using multilocus linkage
              disequilibrium (LD) to infer recombination among microsatellite
              alleles, high mutation rates confound the estimates of
              recombination. To distinguish high mutation rates from
              recombination to infer outcrossing, 8 population samples
              comprising 268 S. sclerotiorum isolates from widely distributed
              agricultural fields were genotyped for 12 microsatellite markers,
              resulting in multiple polymorphic markers on three chromosomes.
              Each isolate was homokaryotic for the 12 loci. Pairwise LD was
              estimated using three methods: Fisher's exact test, index of
              association (IA) and Hedrick's D'. For most of the populations,
              pairwise LD decayed with increasing physical distance between
              loci in two of the three chromosomes. Therefore, the observed
              recombination of alleles cannot be simply attributed to mutation
              alone. Different recombination rates in various DNA regions
              (recombination hot/cold spots) and different evolutionary
              histories of the populations could explain the observed
              differences in rates of LD decay among the chromosomes and among
              populations. The majority of the isolates exhibited mycelial
              incompatibility, minimizing the possibility of heterokaryon
              formation and mitotic recombination. Thus, the observed high
              intrachromosomal recombination is due to meiotic recombination,
              suggesting frequent outcrossing in these populations, supporting
              the view that homothallism favors universal compatibility of
              gametes instead of traditionally believed haploid selfing in S.

              S. sclerotiorum populations to the Western United States.
              Isolates of S. sclerotiorum (N = 294) were determined to

              California (CA, lettuce), Washington (WA, pea/lentil), and
              Ontario (ON, lettuce). CA was the most diverse population yet

  abstract = "Filamentous fungi grow as a multicellular, multinuclear network
              of filament-shaped cells called hyphae. A fungal individual can
              be viewed as a fluid, dynamic system that is characterized by
              hyphal tip growth, branching, and hyphal fusion (anastomosis).
              Hyphal anastomosis is especially important in such nonlinear
              systems for the purposes of communication and homeostasis.
              Filamentous fungi can also undergo hyphal fusion with different
              individuals to form heterokaryons. However, the viability of such
              heterokaryons is dependent upon genetic constitution at
              heterokaryon incompatibility (het) loci. If hyphal fusion occurs
              between strains that differ in allelic specificity at het loci,
              vegetative incompatibility, which is characterized by hyphal
              compartmentation and cell lysis, is induced. This review covers
              microscopic and genetic analysis of hyphal fusion and the
              molecular and genetic analysis of the consequence of hyphal
              fusion between individuals that differ in specificity at het loci

              fine-scale population divergence. To preserve the cladistic
              structure in the network for both nonrecombinant and
              postrecombinant haplotypes in highly recombinant clades,
              recombinant events were not removed ('peeled off'), but instead
              were examined in alternative (marginal) networks. Fungi from both
              sampling locations share a common origin with subsequent genetic
              divergence, consistent with expectations for metapopulation
              structure. Evidence for divergence includes (i) lack of shared
              fingerprints between the two locations, (ii) evolution of new
              fingerprints, via transposition and recombination, within 2 years
              on a fine spatial scale within one sampling location, and (iii)

              four cabbage production fields in North Carolina and 16 isolates
              from an experimental cabbage field plot in Louisiana were
              DNA-fingerprinted and tested for mycelial compatibility. In a
              comparison with 594 unique DNA fingerprints of S. sclerotiorum
              from Canadian canola, no fingerprints were shared among Canadian,
              North Carolina, and Louisiana populations. DNA fingerprints from
              the North Carolina sample were distinctive from those of the
              Canadian and Louisiana samples, with significantly more
              hybridizing fragments in the 7.7- to 18-kilobase range. Forty-one
              mycelial compatibility groups (MCGs) and 50 unique DNA
              fingerprints were identified from the North Carolina sample.
              Three MCGs and three fingerprints were identified from the
              Louisiana sample. From the North Carolina sample, 32 MCGs were
              each associated with a unique fingerprint; of these, there were
              11 clones (i.e., cases in which two or more isolates belonged to
              the same MCG and shared the same DNA fingerprint). Six clones
              sampled from two or more fields represented approximately 29\% of
              the total sample (24 of 84 isolates), with six clones recovered
              from fields 75 km apart. There were 10 cases in which one MCG was
              associated with more than one DNA fingerprint and two cases in
              which one DNA fingerprint was associated with more than one MCG.
              The small sample from Louisiana was strictly clonal. The North
              Carolina sample had a clonal component, but deviated from
              one-to-one association of MCG with DNA fingerprint to an extent
              consistent with more recombination or transposition than the
              other two populations sampled.",

              assessed with eight microsatellite markers and mycelial

              with sensitivity to three fungicides, production of oxalate and
              sclerotia, growth rate, and virulence on two canola cultivars. No
              shared MCGs or multilocus haplotypes were detected between the
              two populations, and populations differed significantly (P <
              0.001). Recombination was detected in both populations but was
              greater in the Chinese population. A polymerase chain reaction
              detection assay showed that ~60\% of the isolates were
              inversion-plus at the mating type locus. The two populations
              differed significantly (P < 0.05) for all of the phenotypic
              traits except for sensitivity to fungicide fluazinam and
              virulence. Isolates in the Chinese population were unique in

              phenotypic traits. Cross resistance to benomyl and iprodione was
              detected. Virulence was not significantly correlated with any
              other phenotypic trait and had the least heritability. However,

              a moderately resistant canola cultivars.",
